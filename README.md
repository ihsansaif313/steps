# Steps Navigation Component

This repository contains a simple React component that demonstrates navigation through multiple steps. The component is rendered twice in the main application to show how each instance maintains its own isolated state.

## Features

- **State Isolation**: Each `Steps` component instance manages its own state, demonstrating how state is isolated within components.
- **Step Navigation**: Users can navigate between steps using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
- **Visibility Toggle**: Each `Steps` component can be toggled open or closed independently.

## Benefits for Students

This code offers several educational benefits for students learning React:
- **Component Reusability**: By rendering the `Steps` component twice, students can observe how the same component can be reused with isolated state management.
- **State Management**: The example provides a clear demonstration of using the `useState` hook to manage component state, including boolean and numeric states.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Students can learn how to conditionally render parts of a component based on the component's state.
- **Event Handling**: The code illustrates how to handle button click events to update the component state and navigate through different steps.
